This repository contains a robust automated testing framework built with pytest and Selenium 4. The framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, and makes extensive use of pytest fixtures and marks to ensure a modular and maintainable test suite.

Key Features
Page Object Model (POM): Implements a structured design pattern where each web page is represented by a dedicated class. 

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Utilizes OOP concepts such as  inheritance to create a scalable and organized codebase.

Pytest Fixtures: Provides reusable setup and teardown code for tests, such as starting and stopping the WebDriver, and handling other test dependencies.

Pytest Marks: Categorizes and manages tests using marks. This allows for selective execution, skipping tests, and organizing tests by different criteria.

Command-Line Execution: Runs tests from the command line using pytest, with flexible options to specify which tests to execute and configure test behavior.

I have integrated data driven concept using get_data fixture and html report.
